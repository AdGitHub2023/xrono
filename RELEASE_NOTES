  - New client login feature:
    > Users can now be given special login behavior via a "Client Login" checkbox
    > Users with "Client Logins" will be isolated to the client_login namespace
    > Users with "Client Logins" have an awesome experience to manage (add/update) their contacts and view their work units
    > Users with "Client Logins" will also be able to see reporting on a per-ticket basis that shows a fancy pie chart.
      The pie chart displays a percentage of completion based on estimated time to complete a ticket and the ammount of
      that estimated time that remains.
